# Demo Performance

## About The Project

The goal of this project is to create, in a few simple steps, a kubernetes work environment, where you can test the performance and resilience of your own web application, through load tests and chaos engineering experimentation.

The following resources will be installed:

- Azure Kubernetes Service
- Azure Load Testing
- Chaos Experiment

This project contains a pipeline that deploys all the previous components to an Azure Subscription. The execution of this pipeline creates the resources, then deploys to the AKS cluster the following resources:

- the Nginx Ingress Controller
- the web app to be tested
- Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the web app metrics
- the Chaos Mesh to simulate random faults

Finally creates and run the JMeter load test and the Chaos Experiment during the load test, to simulate random faults.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions to prepare the environment before start the pipeline.

The first thing to do before installation is to fork your repository.

![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60384226/166690858-8a6bb4d6-198c-4e6e-931b-6dc0148c181c.png)

## Prerequisites

- The Azure AD user to be used in this project must be a subscription owner.
  To check if the AAD user is a subscription owner, open the Azure portal, then open the subscription, and check if the user is listed as Owner in the `Access Control (IAM)` blade, as you can see in the following image
  ![Immagine 2022-05-13 000205](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30232175/168175290-1d22e603-3e28-462f-aa05-d4a2d3d9b0a4.png)
- A Container Registry with an image. If you don't have a container registry with an image check the file [README-createImageForTest.md](README-createImageForTest.md).
- Docker Desktop installed https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

# Installation

## 1. Resource group creation

Create a resource group that will contain all the resources generated.

Before creating the resource group, you should decide the target region. To see the list of current available regions, you can execute this command

```console
az account list-locations -o table
```

Choose a region, and use the "Name" value

To create the resource group, the command is:

```console
az group create -l <REGION-NAME> -n <RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME>
```

Substitute `<REGION-NAME>` with the Name value of the chosen region, then choose a unique resource group inside you subscription and use it in place of `<RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME>`

Sample command:

```console
az group create -l westeurope -n unique-resource-group-aks-demo
```

The command output is a JSON response like this one

```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "location": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```

Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest

## 2. Service Principal creation

Create a service principal identity, and assign the owner role to the group created in the previous step.

> VERY IMPORTANT: Save the statement output in Notepad for use in the next step. If you forget this output, you won't be able to launch the GitHub Action

The command that creates the Service Principal is:

```console
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <SERVICE-PRINCIPAL-UNIQUE-NAME> --role owner --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION-ID> --sdk-auth
```

Choose a Service Principal name that is unique inside you Azure Active Directory, and use it in place of `<SERVICE-PRINCIPAL-UNIQUE-NAME>`.

To get the `<SUBSCRIPTION-ID>` value, use this command

```console
az account show --query id --output tsv
```

The ouptut of this command is something like

```console
xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Copy the output, and use it to substitute the `<ID>` inside the string `/subscription/<ID>`. The result is `/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`, and this is the `<SUBSCRIPTION-ID>` value.

An example of the command that creates the Service Principal is:

```console
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "unique-sp-name-for-aks-demo" --role owner --scopes /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx --sdk-auth
```

Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-cli%2Clinux

## 3. Azure credentials secret creation

Copy the full output from the previous step inside the GitHub secret key AZURE_CREDENTIALS. You can find AZURE_CREDENTIALS in GitHub `Setting-->Secret-->Actions`

Sample

```json
{
  "clientId": "651ca1e0-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-aa7c11e10a57",
  "clientSecret": "QOFEWIJFQewfEWFewqFewFewfEWf34_h.pj",
  "subscriptionId": "74LVd6eb-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-ecec2fm3c22e",
  "tenantId": "72f988bf-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-2d7cd011db47",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```

## 4. Remaining GitHub secrets creation

Create the following GitHub secrets

- **AZURE_RG** containing the Resource Group Name that has been created in the first step of this tutorial. All the Azure resources will be created in this resource group.To remove all those resources, you can delete this Resource Group.
- **AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION** containing the Azure Subscription ID, where the Resource Group was created in the first step of this tutorial.
- **GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD** containing the password to access Grafana. This can be a random guid.

After that, you will have the following secrets
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60384226/166691309-e492dd8c-8bb0-462b-a28d-44e9c5a0df4f.png)

## 5. Customize resources names file

Customize the resources names file `.github\workflows\main.yml`.

In your GitHub repo, go to Code, then browse to `.github\workflows\main.yml`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30232175/168174491-fd576870-cd5a-4790-8228-be66da3d6577.png)

To edi the file, click the `Edit this file` icon.

Then Customize ONLY the value of the following keys, using unique names

```
Customize ONLY the value of the following keys:
  APPNAME:                        "demo"
  KUBERNETESSERVICENAME:          "DEMOKubernetesService"
  AZURELOADTESTINGNAME:           "DEMOAzureLoadTesting"
  CAHOSMESHEXPERIMENTNAME:        "ChaosMeshPodFaultsExperiment"
```

Then commit the changes, using the `Commit Changes` green button, using the ` Commit directly to the main branch` option.

| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Please check that your line endings are correctly set, to be sure, try the command "git add --renormalize ." |

## 6. Subscription resource providers check

**Microsoft.Chaos** and **Microsoft.LoadTestService** resource providers must be registered in the Resource Providers section of the subscription.
Those are the steps to perform the check:

- To be able to register the services you need to go to the Azure portal
- Select the "Subscription" and in the left menu select "Resource Providers"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60384226/165717039-5deec0af-0d8f-42b4-a023-9e6a48232ffd.png)

- Search for "**Microsoft.Chaos**" and check the Status. If it's not _Registered_, proceed with the registration and wait until it's registered.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60384226/165717493-982fdbb9-d3ff-4496-be17-2c6d1052d850.png)

- Search for "**Microsoft.LoadTestService**" and check the Status. If it's not _Registered_, proceed with the registration and wait until it's registered.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60384226/165717225-4396d967-fb16-4c23-b474-d89b5d071f16.png)

## 7. Start the Pipeline

If you have followed all the previous steps you can now start the pipeline, which will create the environment in your Azure resource group.

- First go to the actions section in the GitHub project page.

![Actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60384226/166692831-25fe6373-d2c6-488d-b532-7f6dc964cef3.png)

- Select Manual-Deploy section.

![pipeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33416347/168751095-60939047-9b87-414c-9fc9-0db261c5f79c.PNG)

- Click on "Run Workflow".

![Cattura](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33416347/167612354-072c4295-529d-4cfe-bf04-5bf6e2ef6ca6.PNG)

- Enter the required inputs:
  1. **Set the name of the Container Registry Resource Group** = Set the name of the resource group where the container registry is deployed
  2. **Set Container Registry Name** = Name of container registry that contains the image of the web app to be tested. In the next paragraph it's explained how to get this value
  3. **Set Image Name** = Name of the image present in the container registry to be tested. In the next paragraph it's explained how to get this value
  4. **Set Image Tag** = The Tag of the image to be tested. In the next paragraph it's explained how to get this value
  5. **Set App Replicas** = The desired number of instances of the web app
  6. **Choice Agent Virtual Machine Size** = Size of the virtual machine that kubernetes will create

**IMPORTANT**

- The values **1**, **2** must match an existent Container Registry and should not be changed after the first pipeline run.
- The value **6** cannot be changed after the first pipeline run.
- The values **3**, **4** can be changed to test different web apps present in the same Container Registry.
- The value **5** can be changed to test different load.

### **How to set correct values for Container Registry Name, Image Name and Image Tag**

You can find those values in the Container Registry --> Repositories page
![info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33416347/167634453-c8a5740d-a57b-4701-b5e6-0e240d56f44a.png)

- The string labeled 1 is the Container Registry Name
- The string labeled 2 is the Image name
- The string labeled 3 Image tag

- When you have entered all the inputs, click the green button "Run workflow"
- The workflow creates the Azure resources, then deploys the apps in the AKS cluster.

> **Important**: When you deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in Azure, a second resource group gets created for the worker nodes. By default, AKS will name the node resource group `MC_resourcegroupname_clustername_location`, as you can see [in the AKS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#custom-resource-group-name). This resource group is managed entirely by Kubernetes, and it will be deleted automatically on cluster deletion.

## 8. Retrieve IP for testing

When the pipeline has completed, you can retrieve the IP address of your web app to test it.
If you do not know how to retrieve it you need to go to the file: [README-getExternalIP.md](README-getExternalIP.md) and follow one of the two ways.

## 9. Test the Service

Now that you have retrieved the public IP address of the web app, you can load your web app home page at `http://<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>`, and go to `http://<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>/grafana` you can login in Grafana.

![Grafana](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60384226/166918755-9eaaabe9-802e-40cb-b96c-83dd1947ac5b.gif)

The credentials to login are:

- **username**: admin
- **password**: the one you entered as a secret in step number 4.

# Troubleshooting

Here are some issues that can happen during the installation phases

- **1. Resource group creation** failure. You could be using an existing resource group name. Retry the phase with another name
- **2. Service Principal creation** failure.
  - You could be using an existing name. Retry the phase with another name.
  - Your account isn't a subscription owner. Retry this phase using a subscription owner
- **7. Start the Pipeline** failure.
  - Check the GitHub secrets created in phase #3 and #4, then repeat phase #7
  - The names usend in phase #5 aren't unique, or contain forbidden characters. Change them, then repeat phase #7
  - The Subscription resource providers aren't registered. Check phase #6, then repeat phase #7
  - The input used in phase #7 aren't valid. Check input validity, then repeat phase #7

# Optional Project Customizations

This project allows several customizations. Keep in mind that some values cannot be changed after the first pipeline run.

## Add more VM families before the first pipeline run

If you want more choice in VM families selection, you can modify the GitHub Workflow YAML file, adding more VM Families to the choice.

Here's how to do it

1. Get all available size for specified location

   Every region has a different list of available VM families. To list all the available families, perform the following command, then copy the name of a vm size with no restrictions

   ```console
   az vm list-skus --location <replace with location> -r virtualMachines --output table
   ```

   ![vmsize family](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33416347/167675602-285e3440-c96b-480f-83f0-ab036124273e.PNG)

2. Edit the github workflow

   Modify the `.github/workflows/main.yaml` file by adding the new vm after line 57. Write the name in lower case.
   You can modify the file directly in the GitHub web page, or you can clone the repo locally, perform the editing, then push the modified files to the repo as [you can read here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

## Configure your web app

You can change yor web app configuration in the Helm Chart. You have to edit the `src\helloworld-service\user-service-chart\templates\infrastructure.yaml` file, starting from line 114, for example changing resources requests and limits, or adding environment variables to configure your app, or adding some persistent volume claim. You can modify the file directly in the GitHub web page, or you can clone the repo locally, perform the editing, then push the modified files to the repo as [you can read here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

After the editing, yo shoud re-run the pipeline.

## Azure Load Test

Before the first pipeline run, you can change the default load test file, that you can find in `Bicep\ALT\Test1.jmx`. This load test file can be edited with [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/). You can modify the file directly in the GitHub web page, or you can clone the repo locally, perform the editing, then push the modified files to the repo as [you can read here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

After the pipeline first launch, you can perform load testing using the Azure Load Testing resource created, you can find the documentation [at this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-testing/)

## Default Chaos Experiment configuration

The experiment used in the pipeline disables the application pods for some minutes.

Before the first pipeline run, you can change this behavior configuring the json file located in "./Bicep/ACS/parameters.json".
The configurable value is:

- duration = Duration in seconds of the experiment
  You can modify the file directly in the GitHub web page, or you can clone the repo locally, perform the editing, then push the modified files to the repo as [you can read here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

After the pipeline first launch, you can perform Chaos Engineering running Chaos Experiments as you can see in [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-run-experiment)

## Create new Chaos experiments

For other experiments you will need to enable some capabilities:

1. Open the Azure portal.
2. Search for Chaos Studio in the search bar.
3. Click on Targets and navigate to your AKS cluster.
4. Click on Manage Actions.

   ![select_target](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33416347/167161518-a147d25d-331e-4bd0-b6fe-86f044ef3e64.PNG)

5. Select the desired capabilities and click Save.
